# learning_weaviate_and_llama
This project is just me learning to create vectors using weaviate db and run llama locally and use it with weaviate. This is totally experiment and not structured, hence everything is all over the place.
#### The DB
I'm not sharing my original DB which I used but the structure of the DB is given by the stories folder. 
- This folder contains folder for different levels for which the story is for (level1, leve2).
- Each level folder contain text files whose name contain an id and story title.
- each text file will contain a story.

My code extracts stories from each text file and extracts story title and id from file name and level number from folder name.

The code is experimental and a work in progress.
