A young boy stood on a hill overlooking his village below him, he looked back in time as far as the eye could see. He then noticed that there was something strange going on with one of those people down below... they seemed to be moving so slowly like it was hard for them just walking around.
"That's weird," said the boy "They look different from us."
He watched in wonder, not sure what this meant or why these things were happening but he knew there had to be an explanation of some kind because he couldn't believe that they would live like this forever.
A girl came over and asked him about his thoughts on them being so slow "I think it might have something to do with their bodies... I mean, look at how strange all the others are."
The boy nodded in agreement but then noticed one of these creatures moving faster than usual which made no sense because they were always walking so slowly. He turned his head around and started running down into town as fast as he could go to see what was going on with this creature who seemed to be outpacing all the others before him...
"Oh! What's happening?!" shouted someone from behind but it didn't matter because they were already there, staring right back at them - looking just like normal humans except for their skin which had turned greyish white with blue veins running through every inch of flesh on top before finally revealing themselves underneath each layer as if being peeled away until nothing remained but bone...
The boy watched silently while the girl whispered something into his ear "I don't know what this means..." she said shakily
"Yet I think it may mean that these creatures are becoming more human than they ever were before."
